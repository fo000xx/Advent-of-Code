I'm behind on aoc due to illness, I'd like to correct the move() function once I have time.

Currently it will complete the moves correctly but it does not actually update the cratesLayout vector, I assume as I'm not
passing this through, but instead passing through the subvectors these are all that are updating, but not being saved.
